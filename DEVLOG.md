## 2026-03-13 — Issue #1: Scaffold Laravel 12 with Livewire Starter Kit

### The Change

Completed the scaffolding verification and configuration on top of the initial Laravel 12 + Livewire starter kit install.

**Files modified:**
- `config/database.php` — Configured SQLite WAL mode, busy timeout (10s), synchronous normal
- `routes/web.php` — Added smoke-test route behind auth middleware

**Files created:**
- `app/Services/.gitkeep`, `app/DTOs/.gitkeep`, `app/Enums/.gitkeep` — Base directory structure
- `app/Livewire/SmokeTest.php` — Counter component (multi-file format)
- `resources/views/livewire/smoke-test.blade.php` — Smoke test Blade view
- `resources/views/smoke-test.blade.php` — Page wrapper using app layout
- `tests/Feature/SmokeTestComponentTest.php` — 3 Pest tests: renders, increments, auth guard

### The Reasoning

- **SQLite WAL mode**: Enables concurrent reads/writes critical for web apps. `busy_timeout=10000` prevents "database locked" errors. `synchronous=normal` balances performance and durability.
- **Multi-file component for SmokeTest**: The project uses view-based (⚡) SFC for full-page settings components, but standalone reusable components belong in `app/Livewire/` as separate classes — matching the existing `Logout` action pattern.
- **Directory structure**: `Services/`, `DTOs/`, `Enums/` created early so the team has clear conventions from day one.

### The Tech Debt

- None introduced. The smoke test component can be removed once real features are in place.

### Verification

- `npm run build` — Vite + Tailwind CSS v4 compiles cleanly
- `./vendor/bin/pest --compact` — 36 tests pass (82 assertions)
- `./vendor/bin/pint --dirty --format agent` — All PHP files pass formatting
